			<h1 align="center">HOW TO PREVENT A HARD DRIVE CRASH</h1>

			<p>A hard drive is a mechanical storage path of the computer.The more it gets filled up, the more it slows in accessing data and information from it(reason being that it's a mechanical device).If this processes persists‚ùó, it crashes down‚ú≥</p><br>
			<span><h2>The following are ways to preventing a hard drive crash:</h2></span>
			<p>1. With a start, try to have a backup of all important files and softwares on your computer.</p>
			<p>2. Keep files which you don't use off the hard driveüìº and run defrag</p>
			<p>3.Keep your antivirus programme to date by scanning Your disks and regularly do a full virus scan of your computer. Check your antivirus program as it will tell you when the last full scan was done. If you don't have an up to date antivirus program, and don't want to pay for a new one, there are several high quality free ones available to the private consumer. They are: AVG, Antivr, avast, Comodo antivirus and the open source ClamAV.</p>
			<p>4.Make Sure Your Antivirus/Internet Security programs run  üîÉat night If you are noticing slowness in your PC and you hear your hard drive churning, it may be because the antivirus is doing a scan during the middle of the day.</p>
			<p>5.Hibernation: this is common habit we do whenever we are on the system. whenever hibernation is activated, a file easily 1 GB in size is created in the root of the C: drive. Try turning it off.</p>.<br>
			<h2><span>Follow These Steps To Recover Your important files incase your Hard Drive crashes:</span></h2><br>
			<p>First, turn off the computer. If the computer continues to restart after the Windows logo appears without giving a chance to access the desktop and a blue screen flashes for a split second, it is most likely a registry problem, virus or hard drive fail. It's very painful when important files are lost, but there is a way to recover them before reformatting the computer.</p>
			<span>1.Try getting an external hard drive cases. After the case is purchased,</span>
			<span>2.Carefully remove the hard drive from the computer by detaching the connected wires,</span>
			<span>3.Plug the hard drive into the case and it will act as an external USB drive.üòì Once this is completed,</span>
			<span>4.Attach it to another computer and hopefully it will show up as another drive.üòØ If this works,</span>
			<span>5.Simply drag and drop the important files onto the computer and back them up onto a USB stick or DVD disc.  üòûIf this doesn't work,</span>
			<p>6.The hard drive has either failed or it's not connected properly.But most likely it works..Now that the files are safe, it is time to reboot the computer.</p>
			<p>Ideally, when a computer is purchased, the user will make a back up disc of the operating system in case of a meltdown. You need to go get a new one, or look for a friend with such software.</p>
